        <img src='../images/lasagna.jpg' alt='lasagna'>
        <p>Lasagna (plural “lasagne”) is a flat and expanded pasta sheet, traditionally
            made in Italy with Parmigiano-Reggiano (Parmesan cheese),
            Béchamel sauce (white sauce), and ragù (a meat-based sauce).
            The dish is made by stacking lasagna sheets on top of each
            other with meats, vegetables, cheeses, and tomato sauce between.</p>
